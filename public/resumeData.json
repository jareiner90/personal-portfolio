            "I started my career in banking. There I learned the necessary skills of teamwork, sales, customer service and leadership. I take a passion for leading by example and motivating my peers and team around me in and out of my network.",
            "I found programming a few years ago, I wanted to know how computers actually work and network together. In that question I found a new passion. In the beginning of my journey I started by Learning the languages of Ruby and Python, following along with simple tutorials I learned the basics of programming. I decided to attend the Flatiron School after not knowing where to take my journey next. Flatiron taught me a lot, I developed a firm understanding of Full Stack Web Development. More importantly Flatiron taught me how to learn and grow in the technology industry. I gained the confidence I need to take on any challenge that I sent my mind to. Being humble while actively striving for the best is a practice that I will always continue to develop. I now believe that becoming a great developer involves being a Google wizard.",
